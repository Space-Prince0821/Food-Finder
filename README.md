# Food-Finder
App allows users to scan dishes that they'd like the recipe for. It provides you with the ingredients and steps you need to take in order to successfully recreate the dish.

We'll be using **Expo** to make it easy to test the app as you code.

**Installing Expo**

First you need to get **node.js:**

https://nodejs.org/en/

Then follow these instructions to install **Expo cli:**

https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/

Then grab the Expo Go app on your phone. Make sure your phone and your computer are on the same network.

Once you have all that installed, navigate to project folder inside your terminal and enter:

**expo start**

If this is your first launch, you'll need to scan a QR code. After that the app should pop-up.

**Running Tests**

This project uses JTest to run tests. After installation, test can be run with:

**npm run test**
